<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>
You interact with JavaScript code all the time — you just might not realize it. It powers dynamic behavior on websites (like this one) and plays an important role in many fields, like front- and back-end engineering, game and mobile development, virtual reality, and more. In this course, you’ll learn JavaScript fundamentals that will be helpful as you dive deeper into more advanced topics.
